## <a id="section_intro">Introduction</a>
We're to spatialze the travelogue around Jerusalem.

## <a id="section_dataset">Dataset</a>
We use the [dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Wz6D2FM25ydFw_-41I9uTwG9uNsN4TCF) provided by the teaching team of "CS-401: Applied Data Analysis" at EPFL for the year 2022.

## <a id="section_clustering_approach">The Approach to Soft-Clustering the Users</a>

We use a score-based approach to soft-cluster users using scores that are easily interpretable to humans. All of our scores satisfy that the larger they are the more they emphasize that the user may belong to the given category.



# <a id="section_story">The Story Overview</a>
In the following sections, we will study the categories defined previously on many levels: beer style preferences, locations, ratings, reviews...etc to extract as much information about these categories as possible to build relevant personas that can be leveraged by the administrators to improve the UX of their website.

## <a id="section_ratings_reviews">How Does the Number of Ratings and Reviews Characterize the Categories?</a>
